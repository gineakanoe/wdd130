                    <figcaption>Our Purpose: <br> <br> White water rafting is a very thrilling sport with the strong current and turbulence in the water. Our purpose is to help customers navigate these rough waters by supplying equipment and/or guides to safely head down the river while having the most fun possible without capsizing the raft. The purpose of our site is to educate people on the dangers of rafting without the appropriate equipment or a guide who knows these waters, as well as to share our love of this fantastic sport with like minded individuals.</figcaption>
