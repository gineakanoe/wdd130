        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>White water rafting is a very thrilling sport with the strong current and turbulence in the water. Our purpose is to help customers navigate these rough waters by supplying equipment and/or guides to safely head down the river while having the most fun possible without capsizing the raft. The purpose of our site is to educate people on the dangers of rafting without the appropriate equipment or a guide who knows these waters, as well as to share our love of this fantastic sport with like minded individuals.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Our target audience are people in their late 20s - early 30s. They have a steady job and their own place, whether that be an apartment or house. They want/need a little excitement in their life to brake up the monotony. They are confident and know their own minds pretty well and what they want out of life. They will usually access our website on their phone or a laptop while they are at work dreaming about what to do that weekend. They want to be able to share a good story with their co-workers next week and show that they lead a great life outside of work. By acessing the website, they will have the questions answered on what is white water rafting, how do they start, what do they need, how safe is it, and should they spend their time and money on this endeavor. Have they ever done this before? What kind of experience are they looking for? Do they have friends they would want to bring with them?  These are some of the questions we want our audience to be asking themselves.</p>
