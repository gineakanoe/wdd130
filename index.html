        <p>Hello! My name is Ginea Merrill, and I am from Indianapolis, Indiana.  I was born and raised here, although I did live in California for about a year about a decade ago.  A little known fact about me is that my name is computer generated.  My dad wrote a program to find all word combinations that start with g and have 5 letters.  It was a very long list and somehow they decided on "Ginea" for my name.  I like reading and photography.  I mostly read fantasy novels like Harry Potter or Name of the Wind, just to name a couple.  For photography, I mostly prefer nature like landscapes and close-ups on flowers.  I also have a dog named Le'a, which means "Joyful" in Hawaiian, since I am part Hawaiian.  She is a Schnauzer - Chihuahua mix and is almost 4 years old.  She is the light and joy of my life and keeps me going when things get hard and rough.</p>
