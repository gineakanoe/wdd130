        <p>Hello! My name is Ginea Merrill, and I am from Indianapolis, IN.  A little known fact about me is that my name is computer generated.  My dad wrote a program to find all word combinations that start with g and have 5 letters.  It was a very long list and somehow they decided on "Ginea" for my name.  I like reading and photography.  I mostly read fantasy novels.</p>
